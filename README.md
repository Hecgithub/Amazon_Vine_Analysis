# Amazon_Vine_Analysis
## Overview of the analysis: 

The purpose of this analysis was to parse the data of Amazon reviews written by members of the paid Amazon program. The analysis was conducted explicitly on U.S. sports reviews. The Amazon vine program is a service that allows manufacturers and publishers to receive reviews for their products. Companies such as SellBY pay a small fee to provide products to Amazon Vine members, who must publish a review. Performing the ETL process on Amazon product reviews will help determine if there is a bias in Vine reviews. 

## Results: 
o	How many Vine reviews and non-Vine reviews were there?

There was a total of 334 Vine reviews and 61,614 non-Vine reviews. 

o	How many Vine reviews were five stars? How many non-Vine reviews were five stars?

There were 139 five-star vine reviews. There were 32,665 non-Vine reviews which were five stars.

o	What percentage of Vine reviews were five stars? What percentage of non-Vine reviews were five stars?

The percentage of five-star vine reviews is 0.004%, and the percentage of non-Vine reviews is 0.99%. 

## Summary: 

Based on the results, there does not appear to be a positivity bias for reviews in the Vine program. As illustrated in the analysis, out of the 334 vine reviews, 139 were five stars which is a 41% ratio. In the non-Vine reviews, there was a 53% ratio. An additional R2 analysis could be conducted on vine reviews, and five-star ratings could support the non-bias statement.
